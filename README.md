# Exploratory-Time-Series-Analysis

## Overview
Scripts that work with inserting CSV files into a MySQL database and then querying it to feed into a statistical model.

Used as a basis for hypothesis testing before further strategy development is carried out.

### Note
*These scripts employ simple but effective statistical techniques to forecast financial time series. The more complicated stuff is proprietary!*
